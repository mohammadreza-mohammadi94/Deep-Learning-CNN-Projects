# Deep NLP Models

This repository contains a collection of NLP projects built with deep learning and popular NLP toolkits.  
The models cover various natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and text classification.

## Features
- Implementations of classic and modern NLP models
- Use of deep learning frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
- Integration with NLP toolkits (NLTK, SpaCy, Gensim, etc.)
- Examples of training and inference

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohammadreza-mohammadi94/deep-nlp-models.git
cd deep-nlp-models
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## Usage

Each project is organized in its own directory.
Navigate to the folder of interest and run the scripts as described inside.

Example:

```bash
cd sentiment_analysis
python train.py
```

Do you want me to make this README **more professional** (with badges, project tree, references) or keep it **minimal and academic-style**?
